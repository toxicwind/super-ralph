The following ${sorted.length} tickets were in-progress from previous runs but never landed.
They should be resumed in the current run before discovering new tickets.

| Ticket ID | Pipeline Stage | Last Run | Iteration |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|
${ticketTable}

For each ticket:
1. Check if the ticket's worktree/branch still exists (jj bookmark list | grep ticket/{ticketId})
2. If the branch exists and has changes, report it as resumable
3. If the branch is gone, report it as needing fresh start
4. Prioritize tickets further in the pipeline (report > review > test > implement > research)

Return the list of tickets that should be resumed with their current state, prioritized by pipeline stage.
Tickets at the review_fix or report stage should be highest priority — they're almost done.`}
